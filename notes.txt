===============================================================================
Object Descriptor Structure

	Each object occupies a 64-byte descriptor structure in memory. The structures
	are allocated slots of memory starting from $D500. For example, the first 
	object will be allocated the slot at $D500, the second will be allocated the
	slot at $D540, and so on.
	
	Typically, the high priority objects (player object, invincibility stars, etc)
	are placed into slots between $D500 and $D700. Lower priority objects (e.g.
	badniks) are placed in slots from $D700 onwards. There are 24 descriptor slots
	in this range.
	
	Details for the object descriptors follow (based on sonic object).
	
	Location: $D500	- Player object descriptor

		$02					-	Tone duration counter?
		$03 -> $04			-	Pointer to tone value
		
		$08					-	Volume change trigger.
		


===============================================================================
Object Animation Sequences

	Animation sequence definitions are stored in bank 31 starting at address
	$8000. 
	
	There are a series of pointers (1 for each object) between $8000  and
	$80C0 which point to the animation sequence for the object. Each sequence
	has another series of pointers for each frame.
	
	Animation frames are defined by an 11-byte structure:
		
		 Byte	|	Description
		--------+----------------------------------
		 1		|	Number of sprites
		 2		|	?
		 3		|	?
		 4-5	|	Pointer to sprite arrangement data.
		 6-7	|	Vertical position offset.
		 8-9	|	Horizontal position offset.
		 10-11	|	Pointer to VRAM char codes.

===============================================================================
Object Sprite Arrangement

		Two words at each position represent the vertical and horizontal
		offsets, relative to the object's X/Y location in the level, at
		which to draw each sprite.
		
		e.g. An object composed of 3x2 sprites might be arranged like 
		this (see data at Bank 31, $9DBE which is used for sonic's 
		sprites):
		
		Data at $9DBE:
			.dw $FFE0, $FFF4
			.dw $FFE0, $FFFC
			.dw $FFE0, $0004
			.dw $FFF0, $FFF4
			.dw $FFF0, $FFFC
			.dw $FFF0, $0004
		
		
		Gives this arrangement:
		
				 -12   -4   +4
				.----.----.----.
			-32	|    |    |    |
				| 1  | 2  | 3  |
				|    |    |    |
				|----+----+----|
			-16	|    |    |    |
				| 4  | 5  | 6  |
				|    |    |    |
			0	'----'----'----'
					   0
		
		You can see from the diagram that the sprite's origin is
		bottom-centre.

===============================================================================
Player Object Animations
	
	Tile art for each of the player object's animation frames is copied to
	VRAM address $0000 on an as-needed basis (see routine at $10BF). In order
	to do this the routine uses the structures in Bank 31 at address $BCCB.
	
	Each 4-byte structure describes a single frame of animation. The first byte
	is the number of the bank which contains the tiles. Following word is a 
	pointer to the tiles for the current frame.	The final byte is the sprite 
	count (i.e. tile_count/2); Sprites are 8x16 so 2 tiles are used for	each 
	sprite.
	
	For example, the idle animation consists of 3 frames:
	
	;frame 1
	.db $04			;bank
		.dw $8900	;address of tile art
		.db $06		;sprite count
	;frame 2
	.db $04
		.dw $AF80
		.db $06
	;frame 3
	.db $04
		.dw $B100
		.db $06
		
===============================================================================
Object Logic

	Object logic is spread over 3 banks. Logic for object numbers 0 to 31 is
	stored in bank 31, logic for objects 32 to 79 is stored in bank 28 and
	logic for objects 80 and onwards is stored in bank 30.
	
	Each logic entry consists of either an instruction to change the animation 
	frame or a command. Frame change instructions consist of 4 bytes:

		Byte	|	Description
	------------+-------------------------
		1		|	Display count. decremented each frame. when count == 0 
				|	next frame is displayed.
		2		|	Frame number. Index of next frame do display.
		3 - 4	|	Pointer to input handler for current frame.
	
	
	Command bytes are variable length and are marked with a preceeding $FF byte. 
	
	Command Bytes:
		Value	|	Operands	|	Description
	------------+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------
		 00		|	None		|	Marks end of animation sequence. Loop back to start of
				|				|	current animation.
		 01		|	None		|	Deallocate the current object. Always used in place of 
				|				|	$FF, $00.
		 02		|	2 bytes		|	Operand is a pointer to a subroutine in bank 2.
				|				|	LABEL_6087 is pushed to the stack as the return address
				|				|	for the sub. Animation continues as per LABEL_6087.
		 03		|	None		|	Do-nothing stub. Exectutes a RET.
		 04		|	4 bytes		|	First word is the new horizontal speed.
				|				|	Second word is the new vertical speed.
		 05		|	1 byte		|	Change sprite state. Operand gets copied to ix+$02 as 
				|				|	the new sprite state.
		 06		|	6 bytes		|	Load a new sprite. First byte is the sprite number.
				|				|	Following word is added to horizontal position of current 
				|				|	sprite & stored as new sprite's horizontal position. Next
				|				|	word is added to current sprite's vertical position and 
				|				|	stored as new sprite's vertical position. Last byte is 
				|				|	copied to (iy+$3F). Animation continues as per $6087.
		 07		|	4 bytes		|	First word is a function pointer. $60AC is pushed 
				|				|	as the return address for the subroutine. Second word is 
				|				|	pointer to subroutine to be loaded as the logic for the 
				|				|	current frame (copied to (ix+$0C).
		 08		|	1 byte		|	Operand is copied to ($D3AB) - triggers loading of chaos
				|				|	emeralds & monitors. Animation continues as per $6087.
		 09		|	1 byte		|	If msb of operand is set, triggers playing a sound.
				|				|	If msb is not set sound is stopped.
		 0A		|	None		|	Animation continues as per LABEL_6087.
		 0B		|	None		|	Animation continues as per LABEL_6087.
		 0C		|	None		|	Animation continues as per LABEL_6087.
		 0D		|	None		|	Animation continues as per LABEL_6087.
		 0E		|	None		|	Animation continues as per LABEL_6087.
		 0F		|	None		|	Animation continues as per LABEL_6087.

	For example: 
		Object 01 (Sonic), State 04 (Looking up):
		
			Sonic_State_04:		;$A736
			.db $06, $10		;display animation frame 6 for 16 iterations of the game loop.
				.dw VF_Player_HandleCrouched		;logic subroutine for the frame
			.db $FF, $00		;command byte to run this logic sequence again.

VRAM Notes

	Sprite tiles written to VRAM between $0000 and $2000.
	Level tiles normally written to VRAM between $2000 and $3800. Note that
	UGZ writes level tiles between $2100 and $3800 and ALZ writes level tiles 
	between $20C0 and $3800.
	
	Name table at $3800.
	Sprite attribute table at $3F00.
	
	A working copy of the SAT is kept in RAM at $DB00. $DB00->$DB3F = VPOS
	attributes. $DB40->$DB7F = HPOS + char codes.
	
	SAT updates are performed in ascending order for even framecounts and
	descending order for odd framecounts. This way, overlapping sprites are 
	drawn in alternating order for each frame. Player sprite attributes are 
	always written first.
	
	The Off-Screen Tile Buffer:
	----------------------------------------------------------
	The engine maintains an off-screen tile buffer around 3 edges of the
	viewport. The buffer consists of 2 rows of tiles above and below the
	camera and one row of tiles to the left. This ensures smooth scrolling
	as the player moves through the level.
	
	A lookup table of offset values to this buffer starts at address $59DB.
	The offsets are all relative to the nametable address (i.e. $3800) and
	are used by tile loading routines to copy the tile values to the 
	correct address in VRAM (see sub $58BA for loading columns and $5966
	for loading rows of tile values).


===============================================================================
Notes on tile loading routines

	Sprite tiles are loaded either at the start of the level or by a PLC
	that is set during the progression of the level.
	
	At least 3 pieces of information are required to load a tileset into
	VRAM: the ROM bank number to swap into frame 2, the source address 
	in ROM & the destination address in VRAM. For uncompressed tilesets
	the number of bytes to copy is also required; For compressed tilesets
	this can be inferred.
	
	Note that, for some objects, only the right-facing sprites are stored
	in ROM. The left-facing sprites can be generated on the fly by the
	engine simply by adding $80 to the bank number (i.e. set the MSB).
	Examples of this are the Newtron and Motobug badniks that are both
	specified for inclusion in the UGZ tileset (see "zone_tilesets.asm").
	
	For information on how the engine performs the horizontal mirroring
	of right-facing sprites see the subroutine "WriteMirroredTileToVRAM"
	in "tile_loading_routines.asm" and the comments for 
	"Data_TileMirroringValues" in "s2.asm".

Bitfield at $D15E	-	Level viewport flags

	Bit 4 is set by subroutine at $5920 after a row of mapping tile data has
	been copied into work RAM. This signales that the row needs to be updated
	in VRAM.
	
	Bit 5 is set by subroutine at $585B after a column of mapping tile data
	has been copied to work ram. This signals that the column needs to be
	updated in VRAM.
